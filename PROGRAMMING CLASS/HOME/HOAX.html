        COVID Myths and Hoaxes
    </h1>
    <p>
        The coronavirus disease 2019 can spread easily because people believe in weird conspiracy theories and think that this disease is not as bad as what the media says. For example: some people believe that 5G mobile networks spread the coronavirus, but that is totally false according to the World Health Organization. In the United States of America, former president Donald Trump suggested people drink disinfectants (bleach, methanol and ethanol) in order to prevent or cure the coronavirus disease. However, the bleach, methanol and ethanol are harmful towards the human body, although it would kill the virus on surfaces. President Donald Trump also suggested doctors use ultra-violet lamps to disinfect the hands or any other part of your body, but the idea was quickly scrapped. The World Health Organization, also said that UV rays will harm the human body and may damage your eyes, and you should only rub your hands with alcohol or with soap water. There are still different theories people believe about but most of them are fake.
