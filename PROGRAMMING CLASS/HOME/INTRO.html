            In this task, I will be doing a report on the coronavirus disease 2019 (also known as COVID-19, Coronavirus disease, COVID, 2019 Novel Coronavirus or 2019-nCov), which is a global pandemic that started in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. This report has several graphs and maps to show the spread of this disease and will also say what the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that caused this pandemic) is formed from, so we know how it infects the human body so easily. It will also give examples of countries or regions that have either successfully or unsuccessfully controlled the pandemic and also the prevention of this disease. The report will also cover why some people believe why COVID-19 is a hoax and fake news about it. I will also cover the different impacts COVID-19 did to humans.
