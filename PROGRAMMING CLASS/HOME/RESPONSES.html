        <h1>
           CHINA 
        </h1>
        <p>
            China is one of the countries that have successfully controlled the coronavirus. Their main way of preventing the disease from spreading was by putting people under a lockdown and making them do a SARS-CoV-2 test. All the cities in the Hubei province experienced the lockdown. They also made family outdoor restrictions, which meant only a certain number of people in a family was allowed to leave the house every few days to get essential supplies, such as food and water. Like that, China got 9 million people tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus in WuHan. China also adopted mask wearing therefore, people could get less likely to be infected. They also created a type of hospital called Fangcang hospital. These hospitals were built inside stadiums and exhibition centres. The Fangcang hospitals had 13,000 beds for isolating people. That meant people did not need to be isolated at home. This is what made China so successful at controlling the spread of coronavirus.

        <h1>
            UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
         </h1>
         <p>
            The United States is a poor example of a country that successfully controlled the pandemic. The main reason behind that is that they did not spend the correct amount of resources on controlling the pandemic. The government underfunded the public health and a sufficient healthcare system made the nation into a failure. There were also policies that were racist towards the indigenous African Americans so that they would have a larger chance to catch the coronavirus disease. The other problem is that former president Donald Trump denies the existence of his American intelligence agencies’ warning about the virus, therefore, the United States of America was not prepared. Trump also did not care about the production of the prevention of equipment for the coronavirus disease (such as ventilators, tests to detect the disease and also masks), but however he focused on the border. He banned foreigners that have recently been in China. Also, travel bans were sufficient against the disease because people could access third-party countries and arrive in the United States of America, making it useless.  Donald Trump also tried to persuade the Americans that COVID was under control (but it obviously was not). So, the disease started spreading across the United States. Trump again on February 26th, 2020 told his citizens that the infected cases were “close to zero” but over the next 2 months the numbers went up by a million. The U.S. also failed to create diagnostic tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the other problem is that they did not have a backup plan, making the situation even worse.

            FRANCE
        </h1>
        <p>
            France is an example of a country that poorly responded to the coronavirus disease. The French had their first case of COVID-19 back on the 24th, January, 2020 and the first death on February 15th. They had the fastest rate of people catching the coronavirus disease. They had 32 cases per 1000 people up to 5th, March, 2021. They were also unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic like having not enough masks or tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They also had people in hospitals that went on strike making less people available to deal with the pandemic. However, they had many advantages compared to other European countries, like having more facilities and more professional doctors. At first, the French government told their citizens that they were going to have a low number of cases, and they were not prepared either, so this was the reason behind their high number of cases. The unprepared government decided to consider the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a national enemy.

            The government tried to split their act into multiple stages. Their first stage was to limit international travel that mainly focused on China and other countries that have lots of COVID cases. The second stage was to restrict large meetings in order to stop the spread of the virus in the community. The third stage was to host a lockdown. On 14th, March, 2020, president Macron decided to close down all schools, universities, all other places except for important shops. All employees had to work from home except for people whose jobs were important e.g. health, medical research, production of essential goods and more. They also fined people who left their house without permission. However, the government only focused the hospital healthcare on the COVID-19 patients and ignored the patients that had other illnesses. The patients who had other illnesses were required to see a personal doctor instead.

            For the second wave of the COVID-19 in France, the government tried to take strong action against COVID-19 under increasing pressure but a rapid number of positive COVID-19 cases were increased throughout October 2020. The government once again closed down most public facilities, ordered a lockdown, and established a night curfew, but the cases still quickly increased. The schools were still opened because the closure would affect the progress of the syllabus. Nursing homes were also opened but there were still some strict restrictions. The main reason behind the spread of France’s coronavirus is because the government did not put any attention to hygiene and protection of people.

        <h1>Australia</h1>
        <p>
            Australia is a great example of a country that dealt with the coronavirus disease 2019. Same as China, they made lockdowns for certain places inside the nation in order to stop the spread of the disease. The Australian government closed down the international borders in March. For the Australians that came back from foreign countries, there was an isolation program for them. They had to stay at home for a period of time. However, people decided to leave their homes. Therefore, the government created a hotel quarantine system. This hotel quarantine system had the authorities watching and guarding the hotel rooms in order for no one to escape. The government also shut the state borders so that the coronavirus can spread even less. They quickly set up a testing and tracing system that would help control the spread of the virus. The state border closure made numerous states reopen their economy just after two months. The international border is still closed because of the mutations of the virus. Sadly, 40,000 Australians are still left in different parts of the world due to the border restrictions. These restrictions and rules made Australia reach 0 cases in certain times. Trust between the government and the citizens also helped out a lot. Australia was the second country after China that grew the coronavirus from a patient sample. This helped international laboratories on defeating the virus. The Australians also set up a drive-through testing clinic for COVID-19, meaning that the citizens can access a testing station easily.
