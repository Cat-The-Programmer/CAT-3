                        Coal ore is a mineral block that drops coal when mined and the deepslate version of itself is a variant of coal ore that can generate in deepslate and tuff blobs. Coal ore can generate in the Overworld in the form of blobs. Coal ore attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-37, from levels 0 to 127, in all biomes. An average of 207 coal ore generates per chunk. Coal ore can replace stone, granite, diorite, andesite, tuff, and deepslate. Coal ore that replaces tuff or deepslate will become deepslate coal ore.

                        An item frame is an entity‌ that displays the item or block that is inside it. A glow item frame keeps itself and the item inside it illuminated, even in the dark. An item frame containing a pair of elytra generates in each end ship. The displayed item can then be rotated by right-clicking the frame. Items displayed in the item frame can turn 45° diagonally, with a total of 8 possibilities (90° and 4 possibilities if it is a map), and the frame outputs a redstone signal depending on the rotation phase that can be interpreted by a redstone comparator (note that this rotation value is separate from the clock or compass rotation). As long as the frame remains placed, it remembers the orientation of the last item it held, and uses it for the next item it holds.‌

                        Paintings are decorative entities that hang on walls. There are 26 paintings in the game. These are mostly based on paintings by Kristoffer Zetterstrand, who also created the Minecraft versions. Paintings can be crafted with any color of wool. The color of the wool used does not influence the picture chosen when the painting is placed. Once placed, it displays a random painting.

                        A trident is a weapon used in both melee and ranged combat and is a rare drop from drowned. Pressing attack while holding a trident deals damage to both mobs and players. Tridents deal 9♥♥♥♥♥ melee damage. A successful hit consumes durability of the trident. Tridents enchanted with Riptide launch the player a certain distance when thrown, with the distance increasing for higher enchantment levels.

                        A minecart is a train-like vehicle entity that runs on rails. A minecart can be placed in the same manner as most blocks but can be placed only on top of a rail. Once placed, it may be derailed by pushing it off the end of the track. After this, it can be railed again by placing a rail directly below it or pushing it onto a track. Minecarts have a predefined speed limit of 8 blocks per second per axis of travel. A minecart traveling diagonally can, therefore, travel up to 11.314 blocks per second.[2] When a minecart comes to a turn it moves diagonally across that turn.

                        Music discs are 13 unique items that can be played in jukeboxes. By default, they play music made by C418 and Lena Raine; however, custom music can be added with the use of a resource pack that replaces the original music or with a mod that adds new music discs. When killed by any skeleton or stray, a creeper drops a random music disc in addition to its normal drops (excluding Pigstep).

                        Food refers to any consumable items that, when eaten, restore hunger points and hunger saturation points, and sometimes cause status effects. They are essential to survival, as going without them eventually causes the player to starve, causing damage until reaching 5 hearts in Easy Mode, and half a heart on Normal Mode. Starvation damage kills the player in Hard and Hardcore modes.

                        A totem of undying is an uncommon combat item that can save holders from death. It is dropped from evokers, which spawn in woodland mansions and raids. If the player is holding a totem of undying in their off-hand or main-hand slot and receives otherwise fatal damage, the totem saves the player from death. The totem of undying must be in the player's hand (main hand or offhand) for it to work—it does not work if it is in the hotbar, unless selected. Any mob that can hold a totem of undying (in a hand or in the mouth) can use it while holding it. The totem can be used only once; it disappears after use.
