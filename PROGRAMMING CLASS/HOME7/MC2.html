                        A creeper is a common hostile mob that silently approaches players and explodes. Due to their distinctive appearance and high potential for killing unwary players as well as damaging the environment and players' constructions, creepers have become one of the icons of Minecraft, both among players and non-players.

                        Zombies are common undead hostile mobs that deal melee damage and attack in groups. They occasionally carry iron swords or shovels and may wear armor. Zombies have 20 health points and are 1.95 blocks tall in the Java Edition. Giants were overpowered variants of zombies that were 20 blocks tall.

                        Ghasts are large white floating ghost-like hostile mobs that live in the Nether which shoot explosive fireballs at the player. They drop gunpowder and ghast tears (which can be used to be brewed into a regeneration potion). Ghasts are cubes with 9 tentacles and have a sound of a sleeping cat.

                        Endermen are tall neutral mobs found in all three dimensions, which have the ability to teleport and pick up blocks. An enderman can be provoked by a player or other mob attacking them or by a player looking them in the eyes. They can be provoked by eye contact from up to 64 blocks away. Endermen open their mouths and begin to shakeâ€Œ angrily if provoked; they also make loud and lengthy sounds while being stared at. If the player continues to maintain eye contact, the enderman does not move, although it may teleport away. Once the player stops looking at the enderman, it runs toward the back of the player to attack, although it ceases if hit by another player or mob. An aggravated enderman runs fast and often teleports to the location of a player or mob up to 32 blocks away (orthogonally). Endermen are not provoked by a player viewing it through a transparent block or while wearing a carved pumpkin.

                        Llamas are neutral mobs that can be tamed and used to transport large shipments of items. Llamas spawn at light level 7 or above. They naturally spawn only above grass blocks in savanna biomes in herds of 4 llamas and in mountains biomes in herds of 4 to 6 llamas. They come in four variants of coat colors: brown, cream, white, gray. Wandering traders always spawn with two leashed trader llamas.

                        A cow is a common passive mob and a source of leather, beef and milk. Cows are found in most grassy biomes. In Java Edition, herds of 4 cows spawn on grass blocks at a light level of 7 or higher with at least 2 blocks of space above, except in snowy tundras and wooded badlands plateaus. Cows rarely spawn individually above grass after world generation. Mooshrooms are variants of cows that gives you mushroom stew when you use a bowl on it.

                        A pig is a common passive mob found in most grassy biomes. Pigs are a source of porkchops and can be equipped with a saddle to be driven. Pigs spawn in groups of 4 above grass blocks at a light level of 9 or more in any grassy overworld place except in snowy tundras and wooded badlands plateaus. Individuals rarely may spawn on grass after the world generation.

                        Chickens are common passive mobs found in most grassy biomes, and are the main source of chicken, feathers and eggs. Baby zombies, its variants and baby zombified piglins have a 5% chance to spawn riding a chicken, forming a chicken jockey. Chicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped. Baby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always wield a golden sword. Harming or killing the chicken does not cause the zombified piglin to attack.

                        A goat is a neutral mob found in mountains biomes. Goats perform high jumps and are a source of milk and goat horns. Every 30 to 300 seconds, if a goat has seen a mob or player who has not moved during the checking interval, it attacks by ramming from up to 16 blocks away. Goats need 4 blocks of empty space between them and a potential target to ram them.
