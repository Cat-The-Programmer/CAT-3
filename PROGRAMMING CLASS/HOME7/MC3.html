                        Coal ore is a mineral block that drops coal when mined and the deepslate version of itself is a variant of coal ore that can generate in deepslate and tuff blobs. Coal ore can generate in the Overworld in the form of blobs. Coal ore attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-37, from levels 0 to 127, in all biomes. An average of 207 coal ore generates per chunk. Coal ore can replace stone, granite, diorite, andesite, tuff, and deepslate. Coal ore that replaces tuff or deepslate will become deepslate coal ore.

                        Iron ore is a mineral block found underground. It is a source of raw iron, which can be smelted into iron ingots. The deepslate version of itself is a variant of iron ore that can generate in deepslate and tuff blobs. Iron ore itself can be obtained by mining it with a stone pickaxe or higher enchanted with Silk Touch. When mined without Silk Touch, iron ore drops raw iron. It is affected by Fortune enchantment, dropping 1–2, 1–3, or 1–4 raw iron respectively with Fortune I, II, and III.
